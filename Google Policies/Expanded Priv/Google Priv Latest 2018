Google Privacy Policy

When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.

This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.

Effective May 25, 2018 | Archived versions | Download PDF

We build a range of services that help millions of people daily to explore and interact with the world in new ways. Our services include:

    Google apps, sites, and devices, like Search, YouTube, and Google Home
    Platforms like the Chrome browser and Android operating system
    Products that are integrated into third-party apps and sites, like ads and embedded Google Maps

You can use our services in a variety of ways to manage your privacy. For example, you can sign up for a Google Account if you want to create and manage content like emails and photos, or see more relevant search results. And you can use many Google services when you’re signed out or without creating an account at all, like searching on Google or watching YouTube videos. You can also choose to browse the web privately using Chrome in Incognito mode. And across our services, you can adjust your privacy settings to control what we collect and how your information is used.

To help explain things as clearly as possible, we’ve added examples, explanatory videos, and definitions for key terms. And if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us.
Information Google collects

We want you to understand the types of information we collect as you use our services

We collect information to provide better services to all our users — from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like. The information Google collects, and how that information is used, depends on how you use our services and how you manage your privacy controls.

When you’re not signed in to a Google Account, we store the information we collect with unique identifiers tied to the browser, application, or device you’re using. This helps us do things like maintain your language preferences across browsing sessions.

When you’re signed in, we also collect information that we store with your Google Account, which we treat as personal information.
Things you create or provide to us

When you create a Google Account, you provide us with personal information that includes your name and a password. You can also choose to add a phone number or payment information to your account. Even if you aren’t signed in to a Google Account, you might choose to provide us with information — like an email address to receive updates about our services.

We also collect the content you create, upload, or receive from others when using our services. This includes things like email you write and receive, photos and videos you save, docs and spreadsheets you create, and comments you make on YouTube videos.
Information we collect as you use our services
Your apps, browsers & devices

We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices you use to access Google services, which helps us provide features like automatic product updates and dimming your screen if your battery runs low.

The information we collect includes unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your request.

We collect this information when a Google service on your device contacts our servers — for example, when you install an app from the Play Store or when a service checks for automatic updates. If you’re using an Android device with Google apps, your device periodically contacts Google servers to provide information about your device and connection to our services. This information includes things like your device type, carrier name, crash reports, and which apps you've installed.
Your activity

We collect information about your activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend a YouTube video you might like. The activity information we collect may include:

    Terms you search for
    Videos you watch
    Views and interactions with content and ads
    Voice and audio information when you use audio features
    Purchase activity
    People with whom you communicate or share content
    Activity on third-party sites and apps that use our services
    Chrome browsing history you’ve synced with your Google Account

If you use our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, we may collect telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls.

You can visit your Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in your account.

Go to Google Account
Your location information

We collect information about your location when you use our services, which helps us offer features like driving directions for your weekend getaway or showtimes for movies playing near you.

Your location can be determined with varying degrees of accuracy by:

    GPS
    IP address
    Sensor data from your device
    Information about things near your device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices

The types of location data we collect depend in part on your device and account settings. For example, you can turn your Android device’s location on or off using the device’s settings app. You can also turn on Location History if you want to save and manage your location information in your account.

In some circumstances, Google also collects information about you from publicly accessible sources. For example, if your name appears in your local newspaper, Google’s Search engine may index that article and display it to other people if they search for your name. We may also collect information about you from trusted partners, including marketing partners who provide us with information about potential customers of our business services, and security partners who provide us with information to protect against abuse. We also receive information from advertisers to provide advertising and research services on their behalf.

We use various technologies to collect and store information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.
Why Google collects data

We use data to build better services

We use the information we collect from all our services for the following purposes:
Provide our services

We use your information to deliver our services, like processing the terms you search for in order to return results or helping you share content by suggesting recipients from your contacts.
Maintain & improve our services

We also use your information to ensure our services are working as intended, such as tracking outages or troubleshooting issues that you report to us. And we use your information to make improvements to our services — for example, understanding which search terms are most frequently misspelled helps us improve spell-check features used across our services.
Develop new services

We use the information we collect in existing services to help us develop new ones. For example, understanding how people organized their photos in Picasa, Google’s first photos app, helped us design and launch Google Photos.
Provide personalized services, including content and ads

We use the information we collect to customize our services for you, including providing recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, Security Checkup provides security tips adapted to how you use Google products. And Google Play uses information like apps you’ve already installed and videos you’ve watched on YouTube to suggest new apps you might like.

Depending on your settings, we may also show you personalized ads based on your interests. For example, if you search for “mountain bikes,” you may see an ad for sports equipment when you’re browsing a site that shows ads served by Google. You can control what information we use to show you ads by visiting your ad settings.

    We don’t show you personalized ads based on sensitive categories, such as race, religion, sexual orientation, or health.
    We don’t share information that personally identifies you with advertisers, such as your name or email, unless you ask us to. For example, if you see an ad for a nearby flower shop and select the “tap to call” button, we’ll connect your call and may share your phone number with the flower shop.

Go to Ad Settings
Measure performance

We use data for analytics and measurement to understand how our services are used. For example, we analyze data about your visits to our sites to do things like optimize product design. And we also use data about the ads you interact with to help advertisers understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We use a variety of tools to do this, including Google Analytics. When you visit sites that use Google Analytics, Google and a Google Analytics customer may link information about your activity from that site with activity from other sites that use our ad services.
Communicate with you

We use information we collect, like your email address, to interact with you directly. For example, we may send you a notification if we detect suspicious activity, like an attempt to sign in to your Google Account from an unusual location. Or we may let you know about upcoming changes or improvements to our services. And if you contact Google, we’ll keep a record of your request in order to help solve any issues you might be facing.
Protect Google, our users, and the public

We use information to help improve the safety and reliability of our services. This includes detecting, preventing, and responding to fraud, abuse, security risks, and technical issues that could harm Google, our users, or the public.

We use different technologies to process your information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your content to provide you with things like customized search results, personalized ads, or other features tailored to how you use our services. And we analyze your content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. For example, Google Translate helps people communicate across languages by detecting common language patterns in phrases you ask it to translate.

We may combine the information we collect among our services and across your devices for the purposes described above. For example, if you watch videos of guitar players on YouTube, you might see an ad for guitar lessons on a site that uses our ad products. Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.

If other users already have your email address or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly visible Google Account information, such as your name and photo. This helps people identify an email coming from you, for example.

We’ll ask for your consent before using your information for a purpose that isn’t covered in this Privacy Policy.
Your privacy controls

You have choices regarding the information we collect and how it's used

This section describes key controls for managing your privacy across our services. You can also visit the Privacy Checkup, which provides an opportunity to review and adjust important privacy settings. In addition to these tools, we also offer specific privacy settings in our products — you can learn more in our Product Privacy Guide.

Exporting, removing & deleting your information

You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Export your data

You can also request to remove content from specific Google services based on applicable law.

To delete your information, you can:

    Delete your content from specific Google services
    Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity
    Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products
    Delete your entire Google Account

Delete your information

And finally, Inactive Account Manager allows you to give someone else access to parts of your Google Account in case you’re unexpectedly unable to use your account.

There are other ways to control the information Google collects whether or not you’re signed in to a Google Account, including:

    Browser settings: For example, you can configure your browser to indicate when Google has set a cookie in your browser. You can also configure your browser to block all cookies from a specific domain or all domains. But remember that our services rely on cookies to function properly, for things like remembering your language preferences.
    Device-level settings: Your device may have controls that determine what information we collect. For example, you can modify location settings on your Android device.

Sharing your information
When you share your information

Many of our services let you share information with other people, and you have control over how you share. For example, you can share videos on YouTube publicly or you can decide to keep your videos private. Remember, when you share information publicly, your content may become accessible through search engines, including Google Search.

When you’re signed in and interact with some Google services, like leaving comments on a YouTube video or reviewing a song in Play, your name and photo appear next to your activity. We may also display this information in ads depending on your Shared endorsements setting.
When Google shares your information

We do not share your personal information with companies, organizations, or individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:
With your consent

We’ll share personal information outside of Google when we have your consent. For example, if you use Google Home to request a ride from a ride-sharing service, we’ll get your permission before sharing your address with that service. We’ll ask for your explicit consent to share any sensitive personal information.
With domain administrators

If you’re a student or work for an organization that uses Google services (like G Suite), your domain administrator and resellers who manage your account will have access to your Google Account. They may be able to:

    Access and retain information stored in your account, like your email
    View statistics regarding your account, like how many apps you install
    Change your account password
    Suspend or terminate your account access
    Receive your account information in order to satisfy applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request
    Restrict your ability to delete or edit your information or your privacy settings

For external processing

We provide personal information to our affiliates and other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. For example, we use service providers to help us with customer support.
For legal reasons

We will share personal information outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

    Meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or enforceable governmental request. We share information about the number and type of requests we receive from governments in our Transparency Report.
    Enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
    Detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security, or technical issues.
    Protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.

We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from your browser or device for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.

If Google is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, we’ll continue to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and give affected users notice before personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.
Keeping your information secure

We build security into our services to protect your information

All Google products are built with strong security features that continuously protect your information. The insights we gain from maintaining our services help us detect and automatically block security threats from ever reaching you. And if we do detect something risky that we think you should know about, we’ll notify you and help guide you through steps to stay better protected.

We work hard to protect you and Google from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of information we hold, including:

    We use encryption to keep your data private while in transit
    We offer a range of security features, like Safe Browsing, Security Checkup, and 2 Step Verification to help you protect your account
    We review our information collection, storage, and processing practices, including physical security measures, to prevent unauthorized access to our systems
    We restrict access to personal information to Google employees, contractors, and agents who need that information in order to process it. Anyone with this access is subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.

Exporting & deleting your information

You can export a copy of your information or delete it from your Google Account at any time

You can export a copy of content in your Google Account if you want to back it up or use it with a service outside of Google.

Export your data

To delete your information, you can:

    Delete your content from specific Google services
    Search for and then delete specific items from your account using My Activity
    Delete specific Google products, including your information associated with those products
    Delete your entire Google Account

Delete your information

In some cases, we retain data for limited periods when it needs to be kept for legitimate business or legal purposes. You can read about Google’s data retention periods, including how long it takes us to delete your information.

We try to ensure that our services protect information from accidental or malicious deletion. Because of this, there may be delays between when you delete something and when copies are deleted from our active and backup systems.
Compliance & cooperation with regulators

We regularly review this Privacy Policy and make sure that we process your information in ways that comply with it.
Data transfers

We maintain servers around the world and your information may be processed on servers located outside of the country where you live. Data protection laws vary among countries, with some providing more protection than others. Regardless of where your information is processed, we apply the same protections described in this policy. We also comply with certain legal frameworks relating to the transfer of data, such as the EU-US and Swiss-US Privacy Shield Frameworks.

When we receive formal written complaints, we respond by contacting the person who made the complaint. We work with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of your data that we cannot resolve with you directly.

ads you’ll find most useful

For example, if you watch videos about baking on YouTube, you may see more ads that relate to baking as you browse the web. We also may use your IP address to determine your approximate location, so that we can serve you ads for a nearby pizza delivery service if you search for “pizza.” Learn more about Google ads and why you may see particular ads.
the people who matter most to you online

For example, when you type an address in the To, Cc, or Bcc field of an email you're composing, Gmail will suggest addresses based on the people you contact most frequently.
phone number

If you add your phone number to your account, it can be used for different purposes across Google services, depending on your settings. For example, your phone number can be used to help you access your account if you forget your password, help people find and connect with you, and make the ads you see more relevant to you. Learn more
payment information

For example, if you add a credit card or other payment method to your Google Account, you can use it to buy things across our services, like apps in the Play Store. We may also ask for other information, like a business tax ID, to help process your payment. In some cases, we may also need to verify your identity and may ask you for information to do this.

We may also use payment information to verify that you meet age requirements, if, for example, you enter an incorrect birthday indicating you’re not old enough to have a Google Account. Learn more
devices

For example, we can use information from your devices to help you decide which device you’d like to use to install an app or view a movie you buy from Google Play. We also use this information to help protect your account.
Android device with Google apps

Android devices with Google apps include devices sold by Google or one of our partners and include phones, cameras, vehicles, wearables, and televisions. These devices use Google Play Services and other pre-installed apps that include services like Gmail, Maps, your phone’s camera and phone dialer, text-to-speech conversion, keyboard input, and security features.
Views and interactions with content and ads

For example, we collect information about views and interactions with ads so we can provide aggregated reports to advertisers, like telling them whether we served their ad on a page and whether the ad was likely seen by a viewer. We may also measure other interactions, such as how you move your mouse over an ad or if you interact with the page on which the ad appears.
synced with your Google Account

Your Chrome browsing history is only saved to your account if you’ve enabled Chrome synchronization with your Google Account. Learn more
services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages

Examples of these services include:

    Google Hangouts, for making domestic and international calls
    Google Voice, for making calls, sending text messages, and managing voicemail
    Project Fi, for a phone plan

Sensor data from your device

Your device may have sensors that can be used to better understand your location and movement. For example, an accelerometer can be used to determine your speed and a gyroscope to figure out your direction of travel.
Information about things near your device

If you use Google’s Location services on Android, we can improve the performance of apps that rely on your location, like Google Maps. If you use Google’s Location services, your device sends information to Google about its location, sensors (like accelerometer), and nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi access points (like MAC address and signal strength). All these things help to determine your location. You can use your device settings to enable Google Location services. Learn more
publicly accessible sources

For example, we may collect information that’s publicly available online or from other public sources to help train Google’s language models and build features like Google Translate.
protect against abuse

For example, information about security threats can help us notify you if we think your account has been compromised (at which point we can help you take steps to protect your account).
advertising and research services on their behalf

For example, advertisers may upload data from their loyalty-card programs so that they can better understand the performance of their ad campaigns. We only provide aggregated reports to advertisers that don’t reveal information about individual people.
deliver our services

Examples of how we use your information to deliver our services include:

    We use the IP address assigned to your device to send you the data you requested, such as loading a YouTube video
    We use unique identifiers stored in cookies on your device to help us authenticate you as the person who should have access to your Google Account
    Photos and videos you upload to Google Photos are used to help you create albums, animations, and other creations that you can share. Learn more
    A flight confirmation email you receive may be used to create a “check-in” button that appears in your Gmail

ensure our services are working as intended

For example, we continuously monitor our systems to look for problems. And if we find something wrong with a specific feature, reviewing activity information collected before the problem started allows us to fix things more quickly.
make improvements

For example, we use cookies to analyze how people interact with our services. And that analysis can help us build better products. For example, it may help us discover that it’s taking people too long to complete a certain task or that they have trouble finishing steps at all. We can then redesign that feature and improve the product for everyone.
customized search results

For example, when you’re signed in to your Google Account and have the Web & App Activity control enabled, you can get more relevant search results that are based on your previous searches and activity from other Google services. You can learn more here. You may also get customized search results even when you’re signed out. If you don’t want this level of search customization, you can search and browse privately or turn off signed-out search personalization.
personalized ads

You may also see personalized ads based on information from the advertiser. If you shopped on an advertiser's website, for example, they can use that visit information to show you ads. Learn more
sensitive categories

When showing you personalized ads, we use topics that we think might be of interest to you based on your activity. For example, you may see ads for things like "Cooking and Recipes" or "Air Travel.” We don’t use topics or show personalized ads based on sensitive categories like race, religion, sexual orientation, or health. And we require the same from advertisers that use our services.
may link information

Google Analytics relies on first-party cookies, which means the cookies are set by the Google Analytics customer. Using our systems, data generated through Google Analytics can be linked by the Google Analytics customer and by Google to third-party cookies that are related to visits to other websites. For example, an advertiser may want to use its Google Analytics data to create more relevant ads, or to further analyze its traffic. Learn more
safety and reliability

Some examples of how we use your information to help keep our services safe and reliable include:

    Collecting and analyzing IP addresses and cookie data to protect against automated abuse. This abuse takes many forms, such as sending spam to Gmail users, stealing money from advertisers by fraudulently clicking on ads, or censoring content by launching a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.
    The “last account activity” feature in Gmail can help you find out if and when someone accessed your email without your knowledge. This feature shows you information about recent activity in Gmail, such as the IP addresses that accessed your mail, the associated location, and the date and time of access. Learn more

detect abuse

When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable your account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.
combine the information we collect

Some examples of how we combine the information we collect include:

    When you’re signed in to your Google Account and search on Google, you can see search results from the public web, along with relevant information from the content you have in other Google products, like Gmail or Google Calendar. This can include things like the status of your upcoming flights, restaurant, and hotel reservations, or your photos. Learn more
    If you have communicated with someone via Gmail and want to add them to a Google Doc or an event in Google Calendar, Google makes it easy to do so by autocompleting their email address when you start to type in their name. This feature makes it easier to share things with people you know. Learn more
    The Google app can use data that you have stored in other Google products to show you personalized content, depending on your settings. For example, if you have searches stored in your Web & App Activity, the Google app can show you news articles and other information about your interests, like sports scores, based your activity. Learn more
    If you link your Google Account to your Google Home, you can manage your information and get things done through the Google Assistant. For example, you can add events to your Google Calendar or get your schedule for the day, ask for status updates on your upcoming flight, or send information like driving directions to your phone. Learn more

your activity on other sites and apps

This activity might come from your use of Google services, like from syncing your account with Chrome or your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics), or it might embed other content (such as videos from YouTube). These services may share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information.

Learn more about how Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.
partner with Google

There are over 2 million non-Google websites and apps that partner with Google to show ads. Learn more
specific Google services

For example, you can delete your blog from Blogger or a Google Site you own from Google Sites. You can also delete reviews you’ve left on apps, games, and other content in the Play Store.
rely on cookies to function properly

For example, we use a cookie called ‘lbcs’ that makes it possible for you to open many Google Docs in one browser. Blocking this cookie would prevent Google Docs from working as expected. Learn more
legal process, or enforceable governmental request

Like other technology and communications companies, Google regularly receives requests from governments and courts around the world to disclose user data. Respect for the privacy and security of data you store with Google underpins our approach to complying with these legal requests. Our legal team reviews each and every request, regardless of type, and we frequently push back when a request appears to be overly broad or doesn’t follow the correct process. Learn more in our Transparency Report.
show trends

When lots of people start searching for something, it can provide useful information about particular trends at that time. Google Trends samples Google web searches to estimate the popularity of searches over a certain period of time and shares those results publicly in aggregated terms. Learn more
specific partners

For example, we allow YouTube creators and advertisers to work with measurement companies to learn about the audience of their YouTube videos or ads, using cookies or similar technologies. Another example is merchants on our shopping pages, who use cookies to understand how many different people see their product listings. Learn more about these partners and how they use your information.
servers around the world

For example, we operate data centers located around the world to help keep our products continuously available for users.
third parties

For example, we process your information to report use statistics to rights holders about how their content was used in our services. We may also process your information if people search for your name and we display search results for sites containing publicly available information about you.
appropriate safeguards

For example, we may anonymize data, or encrypt data to ensure it can’t be linked to other information about you. Learn more
ensure and improve

For example, we analyze how people interact with advertising to improve the performance of our ads.
Customizing our services

For example, we may display a Google Doodle on the Search homepage to celebrate an event specific to your country.
Affiliates

An affiliate is an entity that belongs to the Google group of companies, including the following companies that provide consumer services in the EU: Google Commerce Ltd, Google Payment Corp, and Google Dialer Inc. Learn more about the companies providing business services in the EU.

An application data cache is a data repository on a device. It can, for example, enable a web application to run without an internet connection and improve the performance of the application by enabling faster loading of content.
Browser web storage

Browser web storage enables websites to store data in a browser on a device. When used in "local storage" mode, it enables data to be stored across sessions. This makes data retrievable even after a browser has been closed and reopened. One technology that facilitates web storage is HTML 5.
Cookies and similar technologies

A cookie is a small file containing a string of characters that is sent to your computer when you visit a website. When you visit the site again, the cookie allows that site to recognize your browser. Cookies may store user preferences and other information. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, some website features or services may not function properly without cookies. Learn more about how Google uses cookies and how Google uses data, including cookies, when you use our partners' sites or apps.
Device

A device is a computer that can be used to access Google services. For example, desktop computers, tablets, smart speakers, and smartphones are all considered devices.
Non-personally identifiable information

This is information that is recorded about users so that it no longer reflects or references an individually-identifiable user.
IP address

Every device connected to the Internet is assigned a number known as an Internet protocol (IP) address. These numbers are usually assigned in geographic blocks. An IP address can often be used to identify the location from which a device is connecting to the Internet.
Pixel tag

A pixel tag is a type of technology placed on a website or within the body of an email for the purpose of tracking certain activity, such as views of a website or when an email is opened. Pixel tags are often used in combination with cookies.
Personal information

This is information that you provide to us which personally identifies you, such as your name, email address, or billing information, or other data that can be reasonably linked to such information by Google, such as information we associate with your Google Account.
Sensitive personal information

This is a particular category of personal information relating to topics such as confidential medical facts, racial or ethnic origins, political or religious beliefs, or sexuality.
Server logs

Like most websites, our servers automatically record the page requests made when you visit our sites. These “server logs” typically include your web request, Internet Protocol address, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request, and one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser.

A typical log entry for a search for “cars” looks like this:

123.45.67.89 - 25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 -
http://www.google.com/search?q=cars -
Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 -
740674ce2123e969

    123.45.67.89 is the Internet Protocol address assigned to the user by the user’s ISP. Depending on the user’s service, a different address may be assigned to the user by their service provider each time they connect to the Internet.
    25/Mar/2003 10:15:32 is the date and time of the query.
    http://www.google.com/search?q=cars is the requested URL, including the search query.
    Firefox 1.0.7; Windows NT 5.1 is the browser and operating system being used.
    740674ce2123a969 is the unique cookie ID assigned to this particular computer the first time it visited Google. (Cookies can be deleted by users. If the user has deleted the cookie from the computer since the last time they’ve visited Google, then it will be the unique cookie ID assigned to their device the next time they visit Google from that particular device).

Unique identifiers

A unique identifier is a string of characters that can be used to uniquely identify a browser, app, or device. Different identifiers vary in how permanent they are, whether they can be reset by users, and how they can be accessed.

Unique identifiers can be used for various purposes, including security and fraud detection, syncing services such as your email inbox, remembering your preferences, and providing personalized advertising. For example, unique identifiers stored in cookies help sites display content in your browser in your preferred language. You can configure your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. Learn more about how Google uses cookies.

On other platforms besides browsers, unique identifiers are used to recognize a specific device or app on that device. For example, a unique identifier such as the Advertising ID is used to provide relevant advertising on Android devices, and can be managed in your device’s settings. Unique identifiers may also be incorporated into a device by its manufacturer (sometimes called a universally unique ID or UUID), such as the IMEI-number of a mobile phone. For example, a device’s unique identifier can be used to customize our service to your device or analyze device issues related to our services.

Learn how to control the information that's collected, stored, and shared when you use the Google Chrome browser on your computer or mobile device, Chrome OS, and when you enable Safe Browsing in Chrome. Although this policy describes features that are specific to Chrome, any personal information that is provided to Google or stored in your Google Account will be used and protected in accordance with the Google Privacy Policy.

If you enable Google Play apps on your Chromebook, the use and protection of information collected by Google Play or the Android operating system is governed by the Play Terms of Service and Google Privacy Policy. Details specific to Chrome are provided in this Notice where relevant.
Details about the Privacy Notice

In this Privacy Notice, we use the term "Chrome" to refer to all the products in the Chrome family listed above. If there are differences in our policy between products, we'll point them out.

"Beta," "Dev," or "Canary" versions of Chrome let you test new features still being created in Chrome. This Privacy Notice applies to all versions of Chrome, but might not be up-to-date for features still under development.

For step-by-step guides to managing your privacy preferences, read this overview of Chrome's privacy controls.

    More information

Browser modes

You don't need to provide any personal information to use Chrome, but Chrome has different modes that you can use to change or improve your browsing experience. Privacy practices are different depending on the mode that you're using.
Basic browser mode

The basic browser mode stores information locally on your system. This information might include:

    Browsing history information. For example, Chrome stores the URLs of pages that you visit, a cache of text, images and other resources from those pages, and, if the network actions prediction feature is turned on, a list of some of the IP addresses linked from those pages.

    Personal information and passwords, to help you fill out forms or sign in to sites you visit.

    A list of permissions that you have granted to websites.

    Thumbnail-sized screenshots of pages that you visit most often.

    Cookies or data from websites that you visit.

    Data saved by add-ons.

    A record of what you downloaded from websites.

You can manage this information in several ways:

    You can delete your browsing history information.

    You can clear your cookies and site data by visiting the Cookies and Site Data dialog at chrome://settings/clearBrowserData.

    You can stop Chrome from accepting cookies from Google or other sites. Learn more.

    You can review stored passwords in Chrome settings. Learn more.

    You can view and manage your stored Autofill information. Learn more.

The personal information that Chrome stores won't be sent to Google unless you choose to store that data in your Google Account by turning on Chrome sync. Learn More.
How Chrome handles your information

Information for website operators. Sites that you visit using Chrome will automatically receive standard log information, including your system’s IP address and data from cookies or similar technologies. In general, the fact that you use Chrome to access Google services, such as Gmail, does not cause Google to receive any additional personally identifying information about you. On Google websites and other websites that opt in, if Chrome detects signs that you are being actively attacked by someone on the network ( a "man in the middle attack"), Chrome may send information about that connection to Google or the website you visited to help determine the extent of the attack and how the attack functions. Google provides participating website owners with reports about attacks occurring on their sites.

Prerendering. To load web pages faster, Chrome has a setting that can look up the IP addresses of links on a web page and open network connections. Sites and Android apps can also ask the browser to preload the pages you might visit next. Preloading requests from Android apps are controlled by the same setting as Chrome-initiated predictions. But preloading instructions from sites are always performed, regardless of whether Chrome’s network prediction feature is enabled. If prerendering is requested, whether by Chrome or by a site or app, the preloaded site is allowed to set and read its own cookies just as if you had visited it, even if you don’t end up visiting the prerendered page. Learn more.

Location. To get more geographically relevant information, Chrome gives you the option to share your location with a site. Chrome won't allow a site to access your location without your permission; however, on mobile devices, Chrome automatically shares your location with your default search engine if the Chrome app has permission to access your location and you haven’t blocked geolocation for the associated web site. Chrome uses Google Location Services to estimate your location. The information that Chrome sends to Google Location Services may include:

    The Wi-Fi routers closest to you
    Cell IDs of the cell towers closest to you
    The strength of your Wi-Fi or cell signal
    The IP address that is currently assigned to your device

Google doesn't have control over third-party websites or their privacy practices, so be cautious when sharing your location with a website.

Updates. Chrome periodically sends information to Google to check for updates, get connectivity status, validate the current time, and estimate the number of active users.

Search features. If Google is your default search engine, Chrome contacts Google when you start searching or when you change networks, so you can get the best local web address for sending search queries. If you are signed in to a Google site and Google is your default search engine, searches you perform using the address bar in Chrome are stored in your Google account.

Search prediction service. To help you find information faster, Chrome uses the prediction service provided by your default search engine to offer likely completions to the text you are typing. When you search using the address bar in Chrome, the characters you type (even if you haven’t hit "enter" yet) are sent to your default search engine. If Google is your default search engine, predictions are based on your own search history, topics related to what you’re typing and what other people are searching for. Learn more. Predictions can also based on your browsing history. Learn more.

Navigation assistance. When you can’t connect to a web page, you can get suggestions for alternative pages similar to the one you're trying to reach. In order to offer you suggestions, Chrome sends Google the URL of the page you're trying to reach.

Autofill and password management. Chrome sends Google limited, anonymous information about the web forms that you encounter, including a hashed URL of the web page and details of the form's structure, so that we can improve our Autofill and password management services.

Payments. If you have turned on Chrome sync and you have credit cards stored in your Google Payments Account, then Chrome will offer you the option of filling those cards into web forms. In addition, if you enter a new credit card into a web form, Chrome will offer to save your credit card and related billing information to your Google Payments account. If you use a card from Google Payments or choose to save your credit card in your Google Payments account for future use, Chrome will collect information about your computer and share it with Google Payments to protect you from fraud. On Android, if supported by the merchant, Chrome will also allow you to pay using Android Pay.

Language. In order to customize your browsing experience based on languages that you prefer to read, Chrome will keep a count of the most popular languages of the sites you visited. This language preference will be sent to Google to customize your experience in Chrome. If you have turned on Chrome sync, this language profile will be associated with your Google Account and, if you include Chrome history in your Google Web & App Activity, may be used to personalize your experience in other Google products. View Activity Controls.

Web Apps on Android. On Android devices, if you select "add to homescreen" for a website that has been optimized for fast, reliable performance on mobile devices, then Chrome will use a Google server to create a native Android package for that website on your device. The Android package allows you to interact with the web app as you would with an Android app. For example, the web app will appear in your list of installed apps. Learn more.

Usage statistics and crash reports. By default, usage statistics and crash reports are sent to Google to help us improve our products. Usage statistics contain information such as preferences, button clicks, and memory usage. In general, usage statistics do not include web page URLs or personal information, but, if you are signed in to Chrome and syncing your browsing history in your Google Account without a Sync passphrase, then Chrome usage statistics include information about the web pages you visit and your usage of them. For example, we may collect statistics to identify web pages that load slowly. We use this information to improve our products and services, and to give web developers insight into improving their pages. Crash reports contain system information at the time of the crash, and may contain web page URLs or personal information, depending on what was happening at the time the crash report was triggered. We may share aggregated, non-personally identifiable information publicly and with partners — like publishers, advertisers or web developers. You can change whether usage statistics and crash reports are sent to Google at any time. Learn more. If Google Play apps are enabled on your Chromebook and Chrome usage statistics are enabled, then Android diagnostic and usage data is also sent to Google.

Media licenses. Some websites encrypt media to protect against unauthorized access and copying. For HTML5 sites, this key exchange is done using the Encrypted Media Extensions API. In the process of allowing access to this media, session identifiers and licenses may be stored locally. These identifiers can be cleared by the user in Chrome using Clear Browsing Data with "Media licenses" enabled. For sites that use Adobe Flash Access, Chrome browser for Windows or Chrome OS, provides a unique identifier to content partners and websites. The identifier is stored on your system. You can deny this access in the settings under Content Settings, Protected content, and reset the ID using Clear Browsing Data with "Media licenses" enabled. If you access HD content on Chrome OS, a content provider may ask Chrome for a certificate to verify the eligibility of the device. To verify your device, your Chromebook will share data about its hardware attributes with the website, and will use Verified Access to certify that its cryptographic keys are protected by Chrome hardware. Chrome will prompt you to allow or deny this verification check. Learn more.

Other Google services. This notice describes the Google services that are enabled by default in Chrome. In addition, Chrome may offer other Google web services. For example, if you encounter a page in a different language, Chrome will offer to send the text to Google for translation. You will be notified of your options for controlling these services when you first use them. You can find more information in the Chrome Privacy Whitepaper.
Identifiers in Chrome

Chrome includes a number of identifiers necessary to power features. For example, if you use push messaging, an identifier is created in order to deliver notices to you. Where possible, we use non-unique identifiers and remove identifiers when they are no longer needed. Additionally, the following identifiers help us develop, distribute, and promote Chrome, but are not directly related to a Chrome feature.

    Installation tracking. Each copy of the Windows desktop version of the Chrome browser includes a temporary randomly generated installation number that is sent to Google when you install and first use Chrome. This temporary identifier helps us estimate the number of installed browsers, and will be deleted the first time Chrome updates. The mobile version of Chrome uses a variant of the device identifier on an ongoing basis to track the number of installations of Chrome.

    Promotion tracking. In order to help us track the success of promotional campaigns, Chrome generates a unique token that is sent to Google when you first run and use the browser. In addition, if you received or reactivated your copy of the desktop version of the Chrome browser as part of a promotional campaign and Google is your default search engine, then searches from the omnibox will include a non-unique promotional tag. All mobile versions of the Chrome browser also include a non-unique promotional tag with searches from the omnibox. Chrome OS may also send a non-unique promotional tag to Google periodically (including during initial setup) and when performing searches with Google. Learn more.

    Field trials. We sometimes conduct limited tests of new features. Chrome includes a seed number that is randomly selected on first run to assign browsers to experiment groups. Experiments may also be limited by country (determined by your IP address), operating system, Chrome version, and other parameters. A list of field trials that are currently active on your installation of Chrome is included in all requests sent to Google. Learn more.

Signed-in, Synced Chrome mode

When you sign in to the Chrome browser or a Chromebook and sync with your Google Account, your personal browsing data is saved on Google's servers and synced with your account. This type of information can include:

    Browsing history
    Bookmarks
    Tabs
    Passwords and Autofill information
    Other browser settings, like installed extensions

These settings are loaded for you anytime you sign in and sync to Chrome on other computers and devices. On desktop versions of Chrome, signing into or out of any Google web service (e.g. google.com) signs you into or out of Chrome. Sync is only enabled if you choose. To customize the specific information that you synchronize, use the "Settings" menu. Learn more. You can see the amount of Chrome data stored for your Google Account and manage it on the Chrome Sync Dashboard. On the Dashboard, except for Google Accounts created through Family Link, you can also disable synchronization completely and delete all the associated data from Google’s servers. Learn more. For children with Google Accounts created in Family Link, sign-in is required and Chrome Sync cannot be disabled because it provides parent management features, such as website restrictions. However, children with these accounts can still delete their data and disable synchronization of most data types. Learn More. The Privacy Notice for Google Accounts created in Family Link applies to Chrome Sync data stored in those accounts.
How Chrome handles your synced information

When you sync Chrome with your Google Account, we use your browsing data to improve and personalize your experience within Chrome. You can also personalize your experience on other Google products, by allowing your Chrome history to be included in your Google Web & App Activity. Learn more.

You can change this setting on your Account History page or manage your private data whenever you like. If you don't use your Chrome data to personalize your Google experience outside of Chrome, Google will only use your Chrome data after it's anonymized and aggregated with data from other users. Google uses this data to develop new features, products, and services, and to improve the overall quality of existing products and services. If you would like to use Google's cloud to store and sync your Chrome data but you don't want Google to access the data, you can encrypt all of your synced data with your own sync passphrase. Learn more.
Incognito mode and guest mode

You can limit the information Chrome stores on your system by using incognito mode or guest mode. In these modes, Chrome won't store certain information, such as:

    Basic browsing history information like URLs, cached page text, or IP addresses of pages linked from the websites you visit
    Snapshots of pages that you visit
    Records of your downloads, although the files you download will still be stored elsewhere on your computer or device

How Chrome handles your incognito or guest information

Cookies. Chrome won't share existing cookies with sites you visit in incognito or guest mode. Sites may deposit new cookies on your system while you are in these modes, but they'll only be stored and transmitted until you close the last incognito or guest window.

Browser configuration changes. When you make changes to your browser configuration, like bookmarking a web page or changing your settings, this information is saved. These changes are not affected by incognito or guest mode.

Permissions. Permissions you grant in incognito mode are not saved to your existing profile.

Profile information. In incognito mode, you will still have access to information from your existing profile, such as suggestions based on your browsing history and saved passwords, while you are browsing. In guest mode, you can browse without seeing information from any existing profiles.
Managing Users in Chrome
Managing users for personal Chrome use

You can set up personalized versions of Chrome for users sharing one device or computer. Note that anyone with access to your device can view all the information in all profiles. To truly protect your data from being seen by others, use the built-in user accounts in your operating system. Learn more.
Managing users on Chrome for Enterprise

Some Chrome browsers or Chromebooks are managed by a school or company. In that case, the administrator has the ability to apply policies to the browser or Chromebook. Chrome contacts Google to check for these policies when a user first starts browsing (except in guest mode). Chrome checks periodically for updates to policies.

An administrator can set up a policy for status and activity reporting for Chrome, including location information for Chrome OS devices. Your administrators may also have the ability to access, monitor, use or disclose data accessed from your managed device.
Safe Browsing practices

Google Chrome and certain third-party browsers, like some versions of Mozilla Firefox and Apple’s Safari, include Google's Safe Browsing feature. With Safe Browsing, information about suspicious websites is sent and received between the browser you are using and Google's servers.
How Safe Browsing works

Your browser contacts Google's servers periodically to download the most recent "Safe Browsing" list, which contains known phishing and malware sites. The most recent copy of the list is stored locally on your system. Google doesn't collect any account information or other personally identifying information as part of this contact. However, it does receive standard log information, including an IP address and cookies.

Each site you visit is checked against the Safe Browsing list on your system. If there's a match, your browser sends Google a hashed, partial copy of the site’s URL so that Google can send more information to your browser. Google cannot determine the real URL from this information. Learn more.

The following Safe Browsing features are specific to Chrome:

    Some versions of Chrome feature Safe Browsing technology that can identify potentially harmful sites and potentially dangerous file types not already known by Google. The full URL of the site or potentially dangerous file might also be sent to Google to help determine whether the site or file is harmful.

    Chrome uses Safe Browsing technology to scan your computer periodically, in order to detect unwanted software that prevents you from changing your settings or otherwise interferes with the security and stability of your browser. Learn more. If this kind of software is detected, Chrome might offer you the option to download the Chrome Cleanup Tool to remove it.

    You can choose to send additional data to help improve Safe Browsing when you access a site that appears to contain malware or when Chrome detects unwanted software on your computer. Learn more.

    If you use Chrome’s password manager, Safe Browsing checks with Google when you enter any saved password on an uncommon page to protect you from phishing attacks. In addition, Safe Browsing protects your Google Account password. If you enter it on a likely phishing site, Chrome will prompt you to change your Google account password. If you sync your browsing history, Chrome will also flag your Google Account as likely phished.

    If you are a Safe Browsing user and you are syncing your Chrome browsing history to your Google account, then, to improve the safety and utility of web feature permissions, Chrome may anonymously report the domains on which you grant, reject, and revoke permissions, or ignore or dismiss permission prompts.

    You can always choose to disable the Safe Browsing feature within Chrome.

Privacy practices of apps, extensions, themes, services, and other add-ons

You can use apps, extensions, themes, services and other add-ons with Chrome, including some that may be preinstalled or integrated with Chrome. Add-ons developed and provided by Google may communicate with Google servers and are subject to the Google Privacy Policy unless otherwise indicated. Add-ons developed and provided by others are the responsibility of the add-on creators and may have different privacy policies.
Managing add-ons

Before installing an add-on, you should review the requested permissions. Add-ons can have permission to do various things, like:

    Store, access, and share data stored locally or in your Google Drive account
    View and access content on websites you visit
    Use notifications that are sent through Google servers

Chrome can interact with add-ons in a few different ways:

    Checking for updates
    Downloading and installing updates
    Sending usage indicators to Google about the add-ons

Some add-ons might require access to a unique identifier for digital rights management or for delivery of push messaging. You can disable the use of identifiers by removing the add-on from Chrome.

From time to time, Google might discover an add-on that poses a security threat, violates the developer terms for Chrome Web Store, or violates other legal agreements, laws, regulations, or policies. Chrome periodically downloads a list of these dangerous add-ons, in order to remotely disable or remove them from your system.
More information

Information that Google receives when you use Chrome is used and protected under the Google Privacy Policy. Information that other website operators and add-on developers receive, including cookies, is subject to the privacy policies of those websites.

Google adheres to several self regulatory frameworks, including the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. Learn more.

    About privacy on Google Play Books

January 23rd, 2018 | View archived version

The main Google Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and services, including Google Play. Below, we describe privacy practices specific to books on Google Play. Note that “books” in this policy refers to ebooks on Google Play and does not include audiobooks or other formats.
Practices specific to Google Play Books

The privacy practices that are specific to books on Google Play are:

    To fulfill contractual commitments to rightsholders who license us books, we enforce certain security limits (for example, to prevent abusive sharing of purchased books and to enforce page view limits on some book previews), and we also enforce limits on the numbers of browsers or devices that can access an account during a given period of time. In order to enforce limits on numbers of devices, we will store the unique ID numbers of your devices on our servers. You can delete a device ID number when you wish to stop using that device.
    You will need to have a Google Account in order to purchase books because account information is necessary to provide access to users who bought the book. We limit the information (such as books titles) we provide to credit card companies, and enable you to delete purchased books from your Google Account. However, you will not be able to delete the record of your purchase transaction (including the title of the book) from your Google Payments account history.
    If you are part of a family group on Google Play and purchase books using a family payment method, your family manager will be responsible for these purchases and will therefore see a record of your books purchases made using the family payment method, including titles and genres. Although you will be able to delete purchased books from your Google Account, you will not be able to delete the family manager's records of the purchase transactions.
    In order to enable consistent reading position across devices and provide useful navigation within a book, we store the last five pages (only) in each book a user has viewed with the user's account. We also store pages viewed for security monitoring and/or if the user elects to use the Web History service.
    Special legal privacy protections for users may apply in cases where law enforcement or civil litigants ask Google for information about what books an individual user has looked at. Some jurisdictions have special "books laws" saying that this information is not available unless the person asking for it meets a special, high standard such as proving to a court that there is a compelling need for the information, and that this need outweighs the reader's interest in reading anonymously under the United States First Amendment or other applicable laws. Where these "books laws" exist and apply to books on Google Play, we will raise them. We will also continue our strong history of fighting for high standards to protect users, regardless of whether a particular "books law" applies. In addition, we are committed to notifying the affected user if we receive such a request that may lead to disclosure of their information; if we are permitted to do so by law and if we have an effective way to contact the user, we will seek to do so in time for the user to challenge the request.


Google Payments Privacy Notice
Last modified September 23, 2018

The Google Privacy Policy describes how we treat personal information when you use Google's products and services. Google Payments is offered to Google Account holders and your use of it is subject to the Google Privacy Policy. In addition, this Privacy Notice describes Google privacy practices that are specific to Google Payments.

Your use of Google Payments is governed by the Google Payments Terms of Service, which describes in more detail the Services covered by this Privacy Notice. Capitalized terms not defined in this Google Payments Privacy Notice shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Google Payments Terms of Service.

The Google Payments Privacy Notice applies to Services offered by Google LLC's wholly owned subsidiaries, including Google Payment Corp. ("GPC"). Please consult the Google Payments Terms of Service made available to you within the Service to learn the subsidiary offering the Service.
Information we collect

In addition to the information listed in the Google Privacy Policy we may also collect the following:

    Registration information - When you sign up for Google Payments, you are creating a Google Payments Account that is associated with your Google Account. Depending on the Google Payments services you use, in addition to the information listed in the Google Privacy Policy, you may be asked to provide the following information: Credit or debit card number and card expiration date, bank account number and expiration date, address, phone number, date of birth, social security number or taxpayer identification number (or some other government-issued identification number), and for sellers or businesses specifically, your business category and certain information about your sales or transaction volume. In some cases, we may also ask you to send us additional information or to answer additional questions to help verify your information. Finally, if you register a Carrier or Operator Billing Account, we will ask you to provide us with certain information about your Carrier or Operator account.
    Information obtained from third parties - We may obtain information about you from third parties, including third party verification services. This includes information arising from Google Payments transactions at merchant locations, information regarding your use of payment methods and your accounts issued by third parties that are linked to the Google Payments, the identity of your card issuer or financial institution, information regarding access to balances held in your Google Payments Account, information from a Carrier or Operator in connection with Carrier or Operator Billing, and consumer reports, as the term "consumer reports" is defined by the US Fair Credit Reporting Act.

    Also, for sellers, we may obtain information about you and your business from a credit bureau or a business information service.
    Transaction information - When you use Google Payments to conduct a transaction, we may collect information about the transaction, including: Date, time and amount of the transaction, the merchant's location and description, a description provided by the seller of the goods or services purchased, any photo you choose to associate with the transaction, the names and email addresses of the seller and buyer (or sender and recipient), the type of payment method used, your description of the reason for the transaction, and the offer associated with the transaction, if any.

How we use the information we collect

In addition to the uses listed in the Google Privacy Policy, we use the information you provide to us and to GPC or other of our subsidiaries, as well as information about you from third parties, in order to provide you with Google Payments for customer service purposes, and to protect you from fraud, phishing or other misconduct. Such information may also be used to assist third parties in the provision of products or services that you request from them. We also use the information to review your Google Payments Account to determine whether you continue to meet the terms of the account, to make decisions about your future Google Payments transactions, and for other legitimate business needs related to the Google Payments transactions initiated by you.

Your registration information is stored in association with your Google Account and your registration of a payment method will be stored on Google's servers. In addition, certain data elements may also be stored on your mobile device. We may retain the information you provide for extended periods of time for the purpose of complying with legal process and regulatory obligations.
Information we share

We will only share your personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following circumstances:

    As permitted under the Google Privacy Policy.
    As necessary to process your transaction and maintain your account.
    To complete your registration for a service provided by a third party.
    To inform a third party merchant, whose site or app you visit, whether you have a Google Payments account that can be used for making payment to that merchant.

For example, when you make a purchase or transaction using Google Payments, we make certain personal information about you available to the company or individual you purchase from or transact with. This includes sharing your personal information with the developer from whom you purchased when you use Google Payments to make a purchase on Google Play. When you add a third party form of payment to your Google Payments Account, we may exchange certain personal information about you, such as your name, profile image, email, IP and billing address, phone number, device info, location, and Google Account activity info, with the third party payment provider as necessary to provide the service.

When you visit a participating merchant site or app, the merchant can check whether you have a Google Payments account with an eligible form of payment that can be used to pay the merchant, in order to reduce the likelihood that you will see unusable features on sites or apps.

Any information you provide directly to a third party merchant, website or application is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of merchants or other third parties with whom you choose to share your personal information directly. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party to whom you choose to share your personal information directly.

The information that we collect, including information obtained from third parties, is shared with our affiliates, meaning other companies owned and controlled by Google LLC. Our affiliates, which can be financial and nonfinancial entities, will use such information for their everyday business purposes.

We provide you with the right to opt out of certain sharing between GPC and its affiliates. Specifically, you may choose to opt out of:

    Sharing between GPC and its affiliates of information about your creditworthiness for their everyday business purposes; and/or,
    Our affiliates marketing their products or services to you based on your personal information that we collect and share with them. This information includes your account history with us.

You may also choose to opt out of Google LLC or its affiliates informing a third party merchant, whose site or app you visit, whether you have a Google Payments account that can be used for payment to that merchant.

If you choose to opt out, your choice will be effective until you tell us to change your choice.

If you don't want us to share personal information about your creditworthiness between GPC and its affiliates, or if you do not want our affiliates to use your personal information collected by us and shared with them to market to you, or if you do not want Google LLC or its affiliates to inform a third party merchant, whose site or app you visit, whether you have a Google Payments account that can be used for payment to that merchant, please indicate your preference by logging into your account, going to the Google Payments privacy settings page, and updating your preferences.

We will not share your personal information with anyone outside of GPC or with our affiliates except as described in this privacy notice. As explained above, Google Payments is a product offered to Google Account holders. Data you provide to Google LLC for the purpose of signing up for a Google Account is not affected by the opt-out provisions in this notice.
Information security

For more information about our security practices, please see the main Google Privacy Policy.

The security of your Google Payments Account depends on you keeping your account password(s), PINs, and other access information for the Service confidential. If you share your account information with a third party, he or she will have access to your account and your personal information.

It is your responsibility to control access to your mobile device and the Google Payments application on your device, including keeping your password(s) and/or PIN confidential and not sharing it with anyone. It is also your responsibility to alert Google or the relevant partner if you believe that the security of the information in the Google Payments application has been compromised.

Google Fiber Privacy Notice

Last modified: 2016-04-07 (view archived versions)

The Google Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google Inc. and its affiliates, including Google Fiber Inc. and Google Fiber North America Inc.

This Google Fiber Privacy Notice explains some important additional things we’d like you to know about information we collect when you visit Fiber websites or when you use Google Fiber services, such as Google Fiber TV, Google Fiber Internet, and Google Fiber Phone (we call these together “Fiber”), and how we use and share that information.
Additional information we collect

To sign up for Fiber, users will be asked to provide an existing Google Account or to create a new one. You may be asked to provide additional personal information, such as billing address, service address or location, and bank account information when you sign up for Fiber.

We may also obtain information about our Fiber users from outside sources for marketing purposes (such as commercially available demographic, geographic, or interest information).

We may have a record of whether third party permission was required to install Fiber equipment for a Fiber user, as well as the third party’s name and contact information.

In order to carry out a request to watch a pay-per-view program or other on-demand content, we may collect certain personal information, such as account or billing information and information about the product or service purchased.

During the initial provisioning or installation of Fiber services, and during any subsequent changes, updates or attempts to resolve issues you bring to our attention, we may access and collect technical information from or about televisions, set-top boxes, computer and network hardware and software, modems, phone boxes, or other systems or devices used in connection with Fiber.

When you use Google Fiber Phone services, we collect and maintain your call history (including calling party phone number, called party phone number, date, time and duration of call), voicemail greetings, voicemail messages, Short Message Service (SMS) messages, recorded conversations, and other data related to your account in order to provide the service to you.
How we use information we collect

The Google Privacy Policy explains how we use information we collect. Below is further information about how we use information collected from certain Fiber services.

Google Fiber TV: All information we collect about the use of Google Fiber TV (including use of programs and applications available through Google Fiber TV) may be associated with the Google Account being used for Google Fiber TV. (When information is associated with your Google Account, we treat it as personal information.) For more information about how this may impact your Google Account, visit our Policies Support page.

Google Fiber Internet: We use technical information collected from the use of Google Fiber Internet for network management, security or maintenance purposes and may associate this information with the Google Account you use for Fiber, but such information associated with the Google Account you use for Fiber will not be used by other Google properties without your consent. Other information from the use of Google Fiber Internet (such as URLs of websites visited or content of communications) will not be associated with the Google Account you use for Fiber, except with your consent or to meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.

Google Fiber Phone: All information we collect about your use of Google Fiber Phone may be associated with the Google Account being used for Google Fiber Phone. (Again, when information is associated with your Google Account, we treat it as personal information.) In addition to the uses listed in the Google Privacy Policy, and the article How Google Voice works, we use the information we collect to provide your service, bill you for your service, help you troubleshoot any issues you are experiencing, verify your identity, and protect you and Google Fiber from fraud, phishing or other misconduct. As described below, some of your Google Fiber Phone information is treated as CPNI and used in accordance with federal law.

This notice does not apply to the collection and use of information from other Google services (such as Gmail or Google Search) used while connected to Google Fiber Internet – such information will be treated in accordance with applicable Google policies and terms of service.
Information we share

We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google except in the circumstances (such as with your consent, with domain administrators, for external processing and for legal reasons) as more fully set out in the Google Privacy Policy.

If you use Google Fiber Phone, your phone number may be displayed to the person you’ve called. You can find out how to block your phone number from being displayed here. We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners – like content providers, publishers, advertisers or connected sites.
Customer Proprietary Network Information

We take our duty to protect your Customer Proprietary Network Information (“CPNI”) very seriously. Federal law requires certain voice and Internet access providers, including interconnected Voice over Internet Protocol service providers like Google Fiber Phone, to protect certain personal information that we generate or access in providing the services to you. CPNI for voice services includes, but is not limited to, call details, call location information, and information about the rates and features of the services that you use. CPNI does not include subscriber list information, such as your name, address, or phone number. We may use the information we collect about your use of Google Fiber Phone to send you information about the services in compliance with our obligations to protect your CPNI. Here are the ways we treat your CPNI associated with Google Fiber Phone:

    Securing your CPNI. We implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI. We authenticate you with a password or other permissible means before we disclose any CPNI.

    Using CPNI without your additional approval is limited to specific purposes. By using the Google Fiber Phone services, you allow us to use, disclose, and permit access to your CPNI without your additional approval only for the following limited purposes:
        To provide and offer services and features among the category of services you’re purchasing from us. This includes using CPNI in the normal course of business, such as to enable billing, customer service, and troubleshooting.
        To protect our rights and property.
        To protect our users and other carriers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses of the services.
        To comply with applicable laws and legal process. For any other purpose permitted by federal law.

Except for these purposes, we will not use, disclose, or permit access to your CPNI associated with Google Fiber Phone without your additional approval.



    The Google Privacy Policy applies to all of the services offered by Google and its affiliates, including the Services. This Google Fi Privacy Notice provides additional information about how we collect and use personal information.
    Customer Proprietary Network Information

    We take protecting your Customer Proprietary Network Information or “CPNI” very seriously.In fact, federal law requires telecommunications providers, like Google Fi, to protect certain personal information that we generate or access in providing the Services to you. CPNI includes call details, call location information, and information about the rates and features of the Services that you use. CPNI does not include your name, address, or phone number.

    Here are the ways we protect your CPNI:

        Securing your CPNI. We implement safeguards that are designed to protect your CPNI. We must authenticate you with a password or other permissible means before we disclose any CPNI.
        Using CPNI without your additional approval is limited to specific purposes. By using the Services, you allow us to use, disclose, and permit access to your CPNI without your additional approval only for the following limited purposes:
            To provide and offer services among the category of Services you’re purchasing from us. This includes using CPNI in the normal course of business, such as to enable billing, customer service, and troubleshooting. This also includes related features such as call blocking, call return, repeat dialing, call waiting, caller ID, and call forwarding.
            To provide information services, such as Internet access and voicemail.
            To protect our rights and property.
            To protect our users and other carriers from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses of the Services.
            Comply with applicable laws and legal process.
            Any other purpose permitted by federal law.
        Using CPNI after you choose to opt-in (by default you are opted out). From time to time, we may want to provide you information about Google communications-related services that are not among the category of services that you’re already purchasing from us. You can opt in to receiving this information. You are not required to opt in and your decision not to opt in will not adversely affect how we provide you the Services that you’re purchasing from us. Only if you opt in may we use your CPNI to market you Google communications-related services and share your CPNI with our affiliates and agents in order to provide you those services. Once you opt in, that opt in remains in effect until you affirmatively revoke your opt in or cancel the Services. Learn more about how to manage your opt-in here.
        Using CPNI with your additional approval. Except as provided above, we will not use, disclose, or permit access to your CPNI without your additional approval.

    Information we collect

    In providing the Services to you, we may collect other information in addition to CPNI.However, our use of that information is also limited to specific purposes related to the Services. We may collect information listed in the Google Privacy Policy as well as information related to the Services such as:

    Account information. You may be asked to provide additional personal information, such as billing address, service address, or location. Also, in order to prevent unauthorized access to your account, we may require you to provide an email address, account password, and answers to security questions associated with your account before providing information to you about your account. In some cases, we may ask you to provide additional information to verify your identity.

    Network and Device Information. We may collect information about your use of your mobile devices, our network, and the Services. This information includes:

        Usage Information. In providing Services to you, we maintain information about your calls, texts, and data usage, connectivity status, and information about the quantity, technical configuration, and type of the Services you use, as well as some other information found on your bill.
        Device Performance Information. We may collect information about the performance of the devices you use with the Services, such as any failure of the device to connect with our network, dropped calls, and battery usage.
        Location Data. When your device is turned on or when you use the Services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. This may include information about your current activity (e.g., driving, running, walking, etc.), which lets us know when you may be moving between different mobile and Wi-Fi networks.
        Wi-Fi Access. We may collect information about your usage of Wi-Fi services, the Wi-Fi networks that you use, and Wi-Fi networks that may be available to you. This may include information about the credentials you use to connect to Wi-Fi networks.

    Pay Monthly Device Plan Information. When you apply to purchase a device on the Pay Monthly Device Plan, we may collect information you provide us in connection with that application, such as your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, or other information. We may ask you to send us additional information or to answer additional questions to help verify your identity. We may obtain information about you from a credit bureau or other data broker to determine if you meet our minimum requirements to qualify for the Pay Monthly Device Plan.

    Marketing Information. We may obtain and use information (such as commercially available demographic, geographic, or interest information) about our users from outside sources for the purposes of marketing Google Fi.
    How we use the information we collect

    In addition to the uses listed in the Google Privacy Policy, we use the information we collect to:

        Provide you the Services and enable your purchase of devices.
        Manage your access to the mobile networks and Wi-Fi networks available to you.
        Bill you and collect payment for the Services and devices that you purchased.
        Help you troubleshoot any issues you are experiencing with the Services, your device purchases, or your account.
        Verify your identity.
        Protect you or Google from fraud, phishing, or other misconduct.
        Send you information about the Services and the Pay Monthly Device Plan and offer you additional Google or Google Fi products and services in compliance with our obligations to protect your CPNI.
        If you apply to purchase a device under the Pay Monthly Device Plan, we review your information, including your credit information, to determine if you qualify for the Pay Monthly Device Plan.

    How we share information
    Sharing with third parties

    We will only share your personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google Fi and our affiliates in the following circumstances:

        As permitted under the Google Privacy Policy.
        We may provide personal information to our trusted businesses or persons to provide you the Services based on our instructions and in compliance with the Google Fi Privacy Notice and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
        If you applied to purchase a device on the Pay Monthly Device Plan, we may share certain information with a credit bureau or other data broker to obtain your credit information.

    Sharing with our affiliates.

    We share information with our affiliates, including Google LLC, to:

        Provide you the Services.
        Process your purchase of devices.
        Bill you and collect payment for the Services and devices that you purchased.
        Help you troubleshoot any issues you are experiencing with the Services, your device purchases, or your account.
        Verify your identity.
        Protect you or Google from fraud, phishing, or other misconduct.

    A few things to keep in mind
    Information you may be sharing when you make phone calls

    When you place calls using the Services, your phone number may be displayed to the person you’ve called. If you do not wish to have your phone number displayed, you may choose to block the display of your phone number by dialing *67 prior to dialing the number of the person you wish to call. Blocking your phone number information in this manner does not prevent the display of your information when you dial certain business numbers, including 911 or toll-free numbers.
    Information you may be sharing when you use the Internet

    When you browse the Internet, use mobile applications, or otherwise access the Internet, the Mobile Directory Number (“MDN”) assigned to your mobile device and/or other device-specific information may be transmitted over the Internet. It is possible that third parties can use the MDN and other information to identify your device.

Google Fi Network Policy

    We are committed to providing an excellent user experience that supports any lawful product, service, or application that its subscribers choose to access through the Services. To do so, Google Fi engages in reasonable network management practices. This Network Policy generally describes our network management practices and is subject to change at any time.
    Network Management

    We use various network management techniques to protect our network, systems, equipment, services and users from harm, ensure reliable, quality services to our users, and improve our services. These network management practices can include:

        Using automated systems to analyze network traffic to detect and prevent the distribution of spam and malware.
        Allocating network resources amongst users and devices in manner that promotes the best experience for users.
        Limiting or suspending heavy, continuous data usage that adversely impacts our network’s performance or hinders access to our network. For example, we may automatically terminate any call that exceeds two hours in duration.
        Limiting or suspending usage that we reasonably suspect is unlawful, fraudulent, or does not comply with the Acceptable Use Policy.
        Restricting access to any telephone number and/or certain categories of telephone numbers (e.g., 9XX numbers other than 911), certain websites, portals, or any messages or content.
        Not providing calling capability, including connections to certain geographic locations and special services numbers.
        Limiting data speeds of users who use an excessive amount of data.

    To provide the Services, we also rely on networks, systems, equipment, and services provided by our suppliers. Our suppliers may also engage in their own network management techniques to protect their networks, systems, equipment, and services from harm, and such network management can impact the Services.
    Roaming

    We may choose to allow users to roam (receive service from other networks) in our sole discretion. Whether we allow roaming depends on a number of factors, including the radio transmissions that devices can receive. We make no guarantee that roaming coverage will be available, and we are not responsible for roaming networks. Depending on your mobile device settings, you may automatically roam if there is a gap or interruption in coverage within our network area and roaming coverage areas. Limits on the amount of minutes, number of texts, and amount or speed of data services used while roaming may be applied. Certain Services or features may not be available in roaming coverage areas, and call quality may be lower while roaming. Google Fi reserves the right to deny roaming to any device at any time.
    Device Management

    You may only use the Services with supported devices. A supported device is a device that conforms to all the following requirements:

        does not potentially harm the Services, our network, or our suppliers’ networks;
        complies with Federal Communications Commission regulations;
        utilizes an operating system supported by Services; and
        is certified by us for use on our network.

    We will list supported devices on the Google Fi Website. Not all supported devices are the same, and the Services may perform differently on different devices. Also, some Services may not be available on all supported devices and operating systems, and some features will be available only on devices purchased from us. Modifications or customizations to your operating system could impact the performance or availability of the Services.

    We reserve the right to suspend any device that we reasonably determine is unsupported.Using an unsupported device may enable you to use third party services while roaming outside our network. If you use such third party services, you are responsible for all third party charges that you incur, and we may pass those charges to you as part of your bill. Third party charges may be substantially higher than the usage fees we charge for use of the Services within our network.

    We do not allow stolen devices to use the Services and reserve the right to deny providing services to any device that has been reported stolen or that we reasonably believe may be stolen.
    Telephone Numbers and IP Address

    When you sign up for the Services, we may assign you a personal phone number (the "Personal Number"). We can change, reassign, or eliminate your Personal Number by giving you notice. We may also assign an Internet Protocol address ("IP Address") to your wireless device and can change, reassign, or eliminate your IP Address without giving you notice. You may not assign the Personal Number or IP Address to any wireless device, other equipment or to any other party except as approved by us.

    In addition to your Personal Number, we may assign your device other phone numbers (each an “Additional Phone Number”). We use these Additional Phone Numbers to operate and manage the Services, and they may not be made apparent to you. We can change, reassign, or eliminate any Additional Phone Number at any time in our discretion without giving you notice.

    You may port your Personal Number to another carrier at any time while your Google Fi account is still active. Please be aware that, once the Personal Number for any device has been ported out, it will no longer be able to use the Services. Consequently, we may treat any request to transfer a Personal Number to another carrier as a request for cancellation. We don’t guarantee that any porting of numbers to or from us will be successful.
    Software Updates

    In order to provide you the Services, we provide you software on your device. We may automatically update that software on your device once a new version or feature is available. These changes could affect your stored data or how you have programmed or use your wireless device.

    Google Fi gives you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable and non-exclusive license to use the software provided to you by us as part of the Services. This license is for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the Services as provided by Google Fi, in the manner permitted by these terms. You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell, or lease any part of our Services or included software, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that software, unless laws prohibit those restrictions or you have our written permission.

    Open source software is important to us. Some software used in the Services may be offered under an open source license that we will make available to you. There may be provisions in the open source license that expressly override some of these terms.
    Suspected Fraud

    In certain circumstances, a supplier on which we rely may terminate your Services immediately if that supplier detects fraud. In such circumstances, we do not have control over the termination but will work with you to restore Services if you believe it was done in error. If we suspect fraudulent activity with any of the devices on your Google Fi account, we will notify you of the potential fraud. We may also suspend your device from using some or all of the Services.
    Information about Security

    We make an effort to keep our network secure, but no network’s security is perfect. You should be sure to take whatever steps you believe are necessary to ensure that your data is not accessed by unauthorized third parties. Please be aware of the following:

        Device Storage. Your device may contain sensitive or personal information. Google Fi is not responsible for any information on your device, including sensitive or personal information. You should remove or otherwise safeguard any sensitive or personal information when your device is out of your possession or control, including, but not limited to, relinquishing, exchanging, returning or recycling your device.
        Third-Party Applications. Use of applications or services provided, offered, and/or controlled by someone other than Google Fi (“Third Party Applications”) is not governed by these Terms and may be subject to separate agreement between you and the third party provider. Third Party Applications may access, collect, use or disclose your personal information, including location information, as a result of your agreement to the installation and use of those applications. Google Fi has no responsibility for Third Party Applications.
        Unauthorized Interception. Although it may be illegal for unauthorized people to intercept wireless device calls intended for others, Google Fi cannot guarantee the complete privacy of your calls. Wireless calls by nature may be intercepted by third parties. Google Fi SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INTERCEPTION BY THIRD PARTIES OF COMMUNICATIONS FROM ITS SYSTEM.

    Copyright Issues

    We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process set out in the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act. If you think somebody is violating your copyrights and want to notify us, you can find information about submitting notices here.


G Suite for Education Privacy Notice

This Privacy Notice is meant to help G Suite for Education users and parents understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This Notice includes information about our privacy practices that are specific to G Suite for Education and summarizes the most relevant portions of the Google Privacy Policy, which provides additional examples and explanations that may be useful. We hope you will take the time to read this Notice and the Google Privacy Policy, which both apply to G Suite for Education accounts.
Information we collect

A G Suite for Education account is a Google Account created and managed by a school for use by students and educators. When creating this account, the school may provide Google with certain personal information about its students and educators, which includes a user’s name, email address, and password in most cases, but could also include secondary email, phone, and address if the school chooses to provide that information. Google may also collect personal information directly from users of G Suite for Education accounts, such as telephone number, profile photo or other information they add to a G Suite for Education account.

Google also collects information based on the use of our services. This includes:

    device information, such as the hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number of the user;
    log information, including details of how a user used our service, device event information, and the user's Internet protocol (IP) address;
    location information, as determined by various technologies including IP address, GPS, and other sensors;
    unique application numbers, such as application version number; and
    cookies or similar technologies which are used to collect and store information about a browser or device, such as preferred language and other settings.

How we use information we collect

    In G Suite for Education Core Services
    The G Suite for Education Core Services (“Core Services”) are listed in the Services Summary and include Gmail, Calendar, Classroom, Contacts, Drive, Docs, Forms, Groups, Sheets, Sites, Slides, Talk/Hangouts, Vault, and Chrome Sync. These services are provided to a school under its G Suite for Education agreement and, as applicable, Data Processing Amendment. (Users and parents can ask their school if it has accepted the Data Processing Amendment.)
    User personal information collected in the Core Services is used only to provide the Core Services. Google does not serve ads in the Core Services or use personal information collected in the Core Services for advertising purposes.
    In Google services generally
    Besides the Core Services, G Suite for Education users may have access to other Google services that we make generally available for consumers, such as Google Maps, Blogger, and YouTube. We call these “Additional Services” since they are outside of the Core Services.
    The Google Privacy Policy describes fully how Google services generally use information, including for G Suite for Education users. To summarize, we use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use this information to offer users tailored content, such as more relevant search results. We may combine personal information from one service with information, including personal information, from other Google services.
    Google may serve ads to G Suite for Education users in the Additional Services. For G Suite for Education users in primary and secondary (K-12) schools, Google does not use any user personal information (or any information associated with a G Suite for Education Account) to target ads, whether in Core Services or other Google services accessed while using a G Suite for Education account.

Learn more about Core and Additional Services for G Suite for Education users.
Information users share

A school may allow students to access Google services such as Google Docs and Sites, which include features where users can share information with others or publicly. When users share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines, including Google. Our services provide users with various options for sharing and removing content.
Information we share

Information we collect may be shared outside of Google in limited circumstances. We do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances applies:

    With user consent. We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have user consent or parents’ consent (as applicable).
    With G Suite for Education administrators. G Suite for Education administrators have access to information stored in the Google Accounts of users in that school or domain.
    For external processing. We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.
    For legal reasons. We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

    meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
    enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
    detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
    protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.

We may share non-personal information publicly and with our partners – like publishers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services.
Transparency and choice

We provide a variety of user controls that enable G Suite for Education users to make meaningful choices about how information is used in Google services. Depending on the settings enabled by the school, users can use the various controls described in the Privacy Policy, such as Google activity controls, to manage their privacy and information. We provide additional information for parents, students, and administrators on the G Suite for Education Privacy Center.
Parental review and deletion of information

The parents of G Suite for Education users in Primary/Secondary (K-12) schools can access their child’s personal information or request that it be deleted through the school administrator. School administrators can provide for parental access and deletion of personal information consistent with the functionality of our services. If a parent wishes to stop any further collection or use of the child's information, the parent can request that the administrator use the service controls available to them to limit the child’s access to features or services, or delete the child’s account entirely. Guidance for administrators on how to use service controls to accomplish this is available in the G Suite Help Center.
Interpretation of conflicting terms

This Notice is intended to provide the key information about our collection and use of data for G Suite for Education users, and is consistent with the Google Privacy Policy and the G Suite for Education agreement, which provide additional examples and explanations that may be useful. Where there are terms that differ, as with the limitations on advertising in G Suite for Education, the G Suite for Education agreement (as amended) takes precedence, followed by this Privacy Notice and then the Google Privacy Policy.

YouTube Kids Privacy Notice

Community Guidelines

This YouTube Kids Privacy Notice is intended to help parents understand what data is collected by the app, why we collect it, what we do with it, and our privacy controls. This Notice provides information about our privacy practices that are specific to YouTube Kids and summarizes the most relevant portions of the Google Privacy Policy, which generally describes how we treat user information in Google's products and services.
Information we collect

YouTube Kids collects information based on your children's use of the app, like when they watch a video. This information includes:

    device information, such as hardware model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers;
    log information, including details of how our service is used, device event information, and the device's Internet protocol (IP) address;
    unique application numbers, such as application version number; and
    mobile identifiers, which are a technology similar to cookies used to collect and store information about an app or device, such as preferred language, watch and search history, and other settings.

YouTube Kids doesn't collect personal information like name, address, or contact information from your children.
How we use information we collect

We use the information we collect for internal operational purposes such as for spam and abuse prevention and enforcing our content license restrictions, determining preferred language and providing and improving the service.

We also use this information to offer users personalized content. We associate a mobile identifier that's unique to the app with the videos your children have watched and terms they've searched for to recommend videos likely to be of interest to them, subject to the controls described below.

We use mobile identifiers to provide contextual advertising, including ad frequency capping, unless you enable YouTube Premium, which provides an experience free of paid ads, as described below. The app does not allow interest-based advertising or remarketing.

YouTube Kids does not allow your children to share personal information with third parties or make it publicly available.
Signing into YouTube Kids with your Google Account: Additional Information We Collect and How We Use It

In some countries we allow parents to sign into YouTube Kids with their Google Account to access and enable additional parental controls, customization and viewing preferences and use their YouTube Premium membership in the app.

If available, when you sign into YouTube Kids with your Google Account, the app will collect your Google Account information, such as email address and password, and where available, will collect information associated to parental controls, customization, and viewing preferences that you may have enabled in the app. These may include lists of video blocked from the app, videos you add to the app, information contained on limited profiles you may enable for your children (such as name, month and year of birth, picture, videos your children mark as like or disliked and channels they may subscribe to and watch and search history specific to each child), in addition to the information described above. We will use this information to provide certain additional features, including:

    Give you access to and enable additional parental controls, customization, and viewing preferences, in the app on all your devices. These may include adding or blocking certain videos from the app, the creation of limited profiles for your children, the ability for your children to mark videos that they like or dislike and to subscribe to certain channels.
    If applicable, enabling YouTube Premium benefits, such as offline access to content, background play and no paid ads, in the YouTube Kids app on all your devices.

When you sign in with your Google account, we will use the watch and search history tied to each specific installation of the app to recommend videos on YouTube Kids, as described above, and we will continue to use that watch and search history to recommend videos even if you sign out of the app, unless they are cleared and paused in the settings section as described below.

If you are signed in and have limited profiles for your children associated with your Google Account, we will use the information tied to each restricted profile to offer each child personalized content by recommending videos likely to be of interest to them, subject to the controls described below.
Information we share

We will not disclose individual user information outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances applies:

    With consent
    We will share individual user information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google when we have parental consent.
    For legal reasons
    We will share individual user information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:
        meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request.
        enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations.
        detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues.
        protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.
    For external processing
    We may provide individual user information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.

We may share aggregate information about the use of the app with third parties to, for example, show trends about the use of the app or meet our reporting obligations with partners.
Parental Access and Controls

You can access the videos your children have recently watched in the Watch it again section of the app. You can pause the collection of watch and search history or clear the watch and search history in the parental settings section of the app. If you've enabled limited profiles for your children, you will be able pause and clear watch and search history, or turn on and off search for each child separately. While history is paused, the app will not use new video views or search terms to recommend videos. When watch and search history are cleared, the app resets Recommended and Watch it again videos. If Search is turned off, the app automatically clears watch and search history. Finally, you can always uninstall and reinstall the app on an device to reset the app-specific identifiers used to collect watch and search history, but if you have enabled children's limited profiles, watch and search history will remain linked to each profile until you specifically delete the history.

If you've signed-in, you'll be automatically signed into the YouTube Kids app installed on all the devices where your Google account is signed in. you can unlink your Google Account from a specific installation of the YouTube Kids app by following the prompts in the parental settings section of the app. You can also delete the parental controls, customization, and viewing preferences that are associated with your Google Account at any time by using the in-product tools we provide.

Signing into YouTube Kids with your child's Google Account

In some countries, we offer Google accounts for children under the age of 13 and allow these children to sign into YouTube Kids with their Google account. The Privacy Notice for Google Accounts Created with Family Link describes our privacy practices when your child uses YouTube Kids with their Google Account. When your child uses YouTube Kids without signing into their Google account, the YouTube Kids Privacy Notice applies. Remember that when your child is signed into YouTube Kids with their Google account, the information we collect, including your child's search and watch history and recordings of their voice searches, may be stored with their Google account and used to improve your child's Google experience. To learn more about our privacy practices for your child's Google Account, please see the Privacy Notice for Google Accounts Created with Family Link and the Google Privacy Policy.

Privacy Notice for Google Accounts Managed with Family Link, for Children under 13 (or applicable age in your country) (“Privacy Notice”)

We know it’s important for you to understand what personal information we collect in association with your child’s Google Account, why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete that information. This Privacy Notice and the Google Privacy Policy explain our privacy practices for your child’s Google Account. To the extent there are terms that conflict, such as with respect to limitations on personalized advertising, this Privacy Notice controls.

This Privacy Notice does not apply to the practices of any third party (non-Google) apps, actions or websites that your child may use. You should review the applicable terms and policies for third party apps, actions, and sites to determine their appropriateness for your child, including their data collection and use practices.
Information We Collect

The Google Privacy Policy sets forth our information collection practices. For example, we collect:

Information you and your child create or provide to us.

As part of the account creation process, we ask for personal information like first and last name, email address, and birthdate.  We collect the content your child provides, such as your online contact information, which is necessary for us to contact you to request consent.  We also collect the information your child creates, uploads, or receives from others when using their account, such as when your child saves a picture in Google Photos or creates a document in Google Drive.

Information we get from your child’s use of our services.

We automatically collect and store certain information about the services your child uses and how your child uses them, like when your child enters a query in Google Search, talks to the Google Assistant, or watches a video on YouTube Kids. This information includes:

    Your child’s apps, browsers & devices

We collect information about the apps, browsers, and devices your child uses to access Google services, including unique identifiers, browser type and settings, device type and settings, operating system, mobile network information including carrier name and phone number, and application version number. We also collect information about the interaction of your child’s apps, browsers, and devices with our services, including IP address, crash reports, system activity, and the date, time, and referrer URL of your child’s request. We collect this information when a Google service on your child’s device contacts our servers, for example, when they install an app from the Play Store.

    Your child’s activity

We collect information about your child’s activity in our services, which we use to do things like recommend apps they might like on Google Play. Your child’s activity information that we collect may include things like search terms, videos they watch, voice and audio information when they use audio features, people with whom they communicate or share content, and Chrome browsing history they’ve synced with their Google Account. If your child uses our services to make and receive calls or send and receive messages, for example by using Google Hangouts, we may collect telephony log information like their phone number, calling-party number, receiving-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls and messages, duration of calls, routing information, and types of calls. Your child can visit their Google Account to find and manage activity information that’s saved in their account and you can also manage their activity information by signing in to your child’s Google Account.

    Your child’s location information

We collect information about your child’s location when they use our services. Your child’s location can be determined by using GPS, IP address, sensor data from their device, and information about things near their device, such as Wi-Fi access points, cell towers, and Bluetooth-enabled devices. The types of location data we collect depends in part on your child’s device and account settings. 

    Your child’s voice & audio information                                                                                                                                     

We may collect your child’s voice and audio information. For example, if your child uses audio activation commands (e.g., “OK, Google” or touching the microphone icon), a recording of the following speech/audio, plus a few seconds before, will be stored to their account from any of your child’s signed-in devices, when the Voice & Audio Activity setting is enabled.

We use various technologies to collect and store your child’s information, including cookies, pixel tags, local storage, such as browser web storage or application data caches, databases, and server logs.  We do not require your child to provide more personal information than is reasonably necessary to use the Google products and services available for these accounts.
How We Use Information We Collect

Google’s Privacy Policy explains in greater detail the purposes for which Google collects data in association with your child’s Google Account. In general, we use your child’s information: to provide, maintain, and improve our services; to develop new  services; to customize our services for your child; to measure performance and understand how our services are used; to communicate directly with your child in relation to our services; and to help improve the safety and reliability of our services.

 

We use different technologies to process your child’s information for these purposes. We use automated systems that analyze your child’s content to provide them with things like customized search results or other features tailored to how they use our services. And we analyze your child’s content to help us detect abuse such as spam, malware, and illegal content. We also use algorithms to recognize patterns in data. When we detect spam, malware, illegal content, and other forms of abuse on our systems in violation of our policies, we may disable their account or take other appropriate action. In certain circumstances, we may also report the violation to appropriate authorities.

 

We may use your child’s information to provide recommendations, personalized content, and customized search results. For example, depending on your child’s settings, Google Play may use information like apps your child has installed to suggest new apps they might like.

 

In addition, we may combine the information we collect among our services and across your child’s devices for the purposes described above. Depending on your child’s account settings, their activity on other sites and apps may be associated with their personal information in order to improve Google’s services.

 

Google will not serve personalized ads to your child, which means ads will not be based on information from your child’s account. Instead, ads may be based on information like the content of the website or app your child is viewing, the current search query, or general location (such as city or state). When browsing the web or using non-Google apps, your child may encounter ads served by other (non-Google) ad providers, including ads personalized by third parties.

Information Your Child Can Share

Your child will be able to share information, including photos, videos, audio, and location, publicly and with others, when signed in with their Google Account. When your child shares information publicly, it may be accessible through search engines like Google Search.

Information Google Shares

Information we collect may be shared outside of Google in limited circumstances. We do not share personal information with companies, organizations, and individuals outside of Google except in the following cases:

With consent
We will share personal information outside of Google with consent (as applicable).

With your family group

Your child’s information, including their name, photo, email address, and Play purchases, may be shared with members of your family group on Google.

For external processing

We provide personal information to our affiliates or other trusted businesses or persons to process it for us, based on our instructions and in compliance with this Privacy Notice, the Google Privacy Policy, and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures.



For legal reasons

We will share personal information with companies, organizations or individuals outside of Google if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to:

    meet any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request;
    enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations;
    detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or
    protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users or the public as required or permitted by law.

We may also share non-personally identifiable information (such as trends about the general use of our services) publicly and with our partners  — like publishers, advertisers, developers, or rights holders. For example, we share information publicly to show trends about the general use of our services. We also allow specific partners to collect information from browsers or devices for advertising and measurement purposes using their own cookies or similar technologies.

If your child is signed into YouTube Kids with their Google Account, this Privacy Notice applies. If your child is not signed into YouTube Kids with their Google Account, the YouTube Kids Privacy Notice applies.
Access to Your Child’s Personal Information

If you created a new account for your child with Family Link, you can access, update, remove, and export your child’s information by signing into their Google Account. If you do not remember your child’s password, you can reset it through the Family Link app or Family Link settings on the web. Once signed in, you can use the various controls described in the Google Privacy Policy (such as Google activity controls) to manage your child’s privacy settings and information. If your child created their own account prior to the change of the minimum required age in your country, and you later granted permission for your child to keep their account, you will not have the ability to reset your child’s password or sign in to their account without their permission.  

By default, your child will have the ability to change their activity controls, delete their past activity in “My Activity,” and grant app permissions (including things like device location, microphone, or contacts) to third parties. However, you can limit your child’s ability to make these choices on Android without parental approval by going to Family Link settings (either in the app or on the web) and changing “Manage Google Activity” and “App Permissions” settings to “Only parents.”

You can also use the Family Link app or Family Link settings on the web to edit or modify your child’s Google Account information, review app activity and app permissions, and manage your child’s ability to grant certain permissions to apps to do things like access information from your child’s Android device (such as location, microphone, and contacts). You can also use Family Link to help manage your child’s access to certain features, apps, and services on Android, or change their Android permissions on devices running Android 6.0 and above.

If at any time you wish to stop further collection or use of your child's information, you can delete your child’s Google Account my clicking “Delete account” on your child’s Account Info page in Family Link or on the Family group page in My Account. Your child’s account information will be permanently deleted within a reasonable period of time.

When Your Child Can Manage Their Account on Their Own

When your child turns 13 (or the relevant age as determined by applicable law in your jurisdiction), they are eligible to manage their account on their own.  If your child chooses to manage their Google Account, you will no longer have access to, or be able to exercise control over their account, unless you and your child later choose to set up supervision again through Family Link. Before your child becomes eligible to manage their own Google Account, we will notify you and your child.
